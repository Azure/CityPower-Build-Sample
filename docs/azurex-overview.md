# AzureX - Overview

Application developers have a wealth of features available to them when they are creating cloud-based applications which are hosted on Microsoft Azure. The tasks which are outlined in the sessions listed below will walk developers through the end-to-end story of creating a local application and deploying it to Azure, then leveraging several Azure features like *Azure Portal*, *Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)*, *DocumentDB* and *MongoDB*, *Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates*, *Jenkins Continuous Build Automation*, *Azure Redis* and *Azure CDN*, scaling for Geographic Redundancy, *Azure Traffic Manager*, and Azure features for monitoring your application.

*Time required to complete all of the tasks in these sessions: 00:00*

### Prerequisites

<!-- The following note would come from an include file when hosted on docs.microsoft.com -->

> [!NOTE]
> <a name="note"></a>You need an Azure account to complete these sessions:
