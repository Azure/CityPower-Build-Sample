# Azure OpenDev Overview

Application developers have a wealth of features available to them when they are creating cloud-based applications which are hosted on Microsoft Azure. The exercises which are outlined in the sessions listed below will walk developers through the end-to-end story of creating a local application and deploying it to Azure, then leveraging several Azure features like *Azure Portal*, *Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)*, *DocumentDB* and *MongoDB*, *Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates*, *Jenkins Continuous Build Automation*, *Azure Redis* and *Azure CDN*, scaling for Geographic Redundancy, *Azure Traffic Manager*, and Azure features for monitoring your application.

*Time required to complete all of the exercises in these sessions: 00:00*

### Prerequisites

<!-- The following note would come from an include file when hosted on docs.microsoft.com -->
**NOTE**: You need an Azure account to complete the exercises that are listed in these sessions:

* You can [open an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F): You get credits you can use to try out paid Azure services, and even after they're used up you can keep the account and use free Azure services, such as Websites. Your credit card will never be charged, unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged.
* You can [activate MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F): Your MSDN subscription gives you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services.
