#AzureX Articles

Here is a description of the documents in this folder, along with some pertinent notes:

1. The "*azurex-???.md* file naming convention is only temporary, as are the "*AzureX*" titles in each of the articles.

2. Most of the session articles are *skelton* articles, which the expecation that requisite will be filled-in as the session details are solidified.

3. I included a lot of URLs in most of the articles which link to existing content which provide additional details for each of the subject areas.

4. There is some metadata in YAML format included at the start of each article; this information is required for publishing to docs.microsoft.com, although it will need to be stripped for publication elsewhere (like your GitHub repository)

5. The docs.microsoft.com publishing system provides a bunch of features which I intentionally did not leverage, such as INCLUDE files and built-in formatting for NOTE/IMPORTANT/WARNING callouts.
