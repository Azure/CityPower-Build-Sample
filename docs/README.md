# City Power & Light Overview

Application developers have a wealth of features available to them when they are creating cloud-based applications which are hosted on Microsoft Azure. The exercises which are outlined in the sessions listed below will walk developers through the end-to-end story of creating a local application and deploying it to Azure, then leveraging several Azure features like *Azure Portal*, *Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)*, *DocumentDB* and *MongoDB*, *Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates*, *Jenkins Continuous Build Automation*, *Azure Redis* and *Azure CDN*, scaling for Geographic Redundancy, *Azure Traffic Manager*, and Azure features for monitoring your application.

*Time required to complete all of the exercises in these sessions: 01:00*

## Session list

The sessions in the following list illustrate how developers can take a local application and deploy it to Microsoft Azure, 

* Chapter 1 - These language-specific exercises walk you through creating an application locally and deploying it to Azure:

  * [Deploying a Node.js Application on Azure][Chapter1Node]

* Chapter 2 - These language-specific exercises walk you through leveraging many of the features available to Azure developers; for example:
  * [Leveraging Managed MongoDB and Redis Services for Your Node.js Application][Chapter2Node]

* Chapter 3 - These exercises walk you through scaling your application across geographic boundaries:
  * [Transforming from a Single Virtual Machine to a Highly-Scalable Geographically-Distributed Application][Chapter3]
